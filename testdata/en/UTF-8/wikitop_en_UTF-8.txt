   Henry Wood (1869–1944) was an English conductor best known for his
   association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as
   the Proms. Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies
   at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice
   teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work
   for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur
   Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic
   touring company. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on
   concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to
   conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a
   mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. By the 1920s,
   Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. In
   addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout
   the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy
   of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain
   over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to
   classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and
   nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music
   spanning four centuries. (more...)

   Mount Tarawera rift crater

   Crumbling scoria cliffs surround the rift at the summit of Mount
   Tarawera, a volcano near Rotorua in New Zealand's North Island. This
   500 m (1,600 ft) wide rift was created in 1886 in the country's largest
   historical eruption. The famed Pink and White Terraces were lost during
   the eruption, and over one hundred people were killed.
